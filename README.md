# ELEC291-Coin-Picking-Robot

Design, build, program, and test robot that detects and picks coins. The robot has two modes of operation: Automatic and Manual. In automatic mode the robot must operate within a predefined perimeter defined by a wire carrying an AC current and detect and pick the coins automatically. In manual mode, the robot is remote controlled by an external operator.

# Design Requirements:
1. Two different microcontroller Systems
2. Battery Operated
3. Metal Detection
4. Coin picker mechanism and electromagnet
5. Robot construction
6. C programming
7. MOSFET drivers
8. Perimeter Wire Generator and Detection
9. Automatic Robot Task
10. Manual Robot Tasks
11. Remote
